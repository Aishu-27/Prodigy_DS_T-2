# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## 📌 Project Description

This project involves analyzing the **Titanic dataset** to perform **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and examine **relationships between key variables**.

The objective is to uncover insights and patterns from the data, such as how survival rates are influenced by factors like age, gender, passenger class, and embarkation port. Through visualizations and statistical summaries, the analysis highlights important trends and correlations within the dataset.

## ✅ Tasks Performed
- Handled missing values (Age, Embarked)
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis
- Explored relationships between variables (e.g., `Survived` vs `Sex`, `Pclass`, `Age`)
- Created visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Identified key survival trends and patterns

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

## 📊 Dataset
- Dataset used: **Titanic** (from Kaggle or local CSV)
- Contains information about passengers such as age, sex, ticket fare, cabin class, and survival status
